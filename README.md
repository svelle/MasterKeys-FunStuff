### Fun Stuff with CoolerMaster's MasterKeys SDK

Just a little side project for me to learn C++ Stuffs and implementing external Libraries etc.  
If this get's serious I'll expand this Readme. 

Built with CLion/CMake all the needed files should be in this repo. I've just included x64 libs.  
Currently only working on Windows.

numpadbuilder.html lets you select the keys on the numpad you want to get a keymap for.  
See numPadSegments.cpp for usage. (Special thanks to [@Obbi89](https://github.com/Obbi89) for his help)
